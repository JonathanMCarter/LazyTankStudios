//Forgive me, for I was the tireds and the things kept a changin' and 1st it was nones then it was states and now it r the butts 
//Now it r around the 1 o'clocks...Tony tired
//I planned for more and better, but I'll only implement what makes sense given what I have...which includes time I can stay awake

//Time finished = 2:45AM 
//Scripts that do combat written = 3...1 that started with nothing. 1 that was using a state machine and 1 where I was given a UI...tbh this is the most visually appealing

//Combat can be activated by opening the menu(esc) and clicking left mouse button whilst selecting items
//...coz thats the easiest way to demonstrate it at the moment
