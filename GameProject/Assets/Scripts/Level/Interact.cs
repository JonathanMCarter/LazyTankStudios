/**
 * Created by: Toby Wishart
*Edit by: Andreas Kraemer

*
* added check for player tag so interact is only invoked if the player is colliding with the object 
* instead of any collision being able to trigger the invoke if Fire1 is pressed
* 
* * *Edit by: Jonathan Carter - made it on enter and not need an input so it will register for the POC
*
* changed triggerstay to collisionstay as the interactable objects use colliders
