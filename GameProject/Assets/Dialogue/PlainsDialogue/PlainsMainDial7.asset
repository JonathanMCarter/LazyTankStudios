  Dialogue:
  - "That\u2019s some fine work you did back there."
  - "What\u2019s it to you stranger"
  - Be still friend, I mean no disrespect. Antwa sent me. Here is your reward for
    your services to the people of Efeskdell. It seems there are more threats at stake.
  - Apologies, Jorah was just the beginning. There three more bandit chiefs out there.
    They will share the same death.
  - Where will you go next?
  - "Wherever the corruption leads me. I\u2019ll find it."
  - Good luck.
