  Dialogue:
  - How could this be?! A survivor! There is nothing left. Get out of here while you
    still can!
  - Forgive me Old man, but what has happened here?
  - That bloodthirsty bandit is what happened! Most of my village has been slaughtered
    our homes burnt to cinders. My crops were all I had.
  - Fear not, I am here to offer my assistance.
  - "It\u2019s a bit late for that don\u2019t you think? But there may still be time
    to warn the rest of the region. Take the southern road and head to the city of
    Arespan! Hurry before they share the same fate."
  - "Thank you for your help. Off to Arespan\u2026"
