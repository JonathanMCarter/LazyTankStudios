  Dialogue:
  - You have returned victorious! The first hero to leave the dungeon alive! Congratulations!
  - "Nothing I couldn\u2019t handle. With skill comes precision."
  - "Indeed. Now then. I\u2019m sending you next to the stronghold, Bandit Cove and
    remove that heartless murderer, Jorah Razortooth from existence! You will forever
    be in my debt."
  - "I shall. Jorah\u2019s time has come.\u201D"
