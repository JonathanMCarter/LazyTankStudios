  Dialogue:
  - The guard informs me that you bring news from Sharpton?
  - Yes my lord, I have come to warn you before Arespan is but a pile of rubble.
  - I see. That merciless maniac must be stopped at once for the sake of Efeskdell.
  - I am more than willing to offer my services.
  - Willing is all well and good, but I need a hero to take on such a task. But fear
    not, I am offering you a chance to prove yourself. I want you to clear a dungeon
    south west of the city. If you succeed, I shall honour our agreement.
  - Consider it done.
