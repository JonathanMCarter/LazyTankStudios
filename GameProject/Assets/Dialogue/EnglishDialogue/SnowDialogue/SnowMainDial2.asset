  Dialogue:
  - "So you\x19re the \x1CHero\x1D that I\x19ve heard so much about?"
  - "I wouldn\u2019t say that, merely offering a help for those in need."
  - "Hero or not. You may have proven yourself in Ekeskdell, but you don\u2019t know
    what you\u2019re up against with that ice-cold wretch, Karyna the Heartless."
  - If you want me to prove my services, so be it.
  - I want you to head to a Dungeon not far from here and clear out every monster
    that you can! Come back to me when the job is finished. No exceptions!
  - "Don\u2019t lose your cool when I return."
