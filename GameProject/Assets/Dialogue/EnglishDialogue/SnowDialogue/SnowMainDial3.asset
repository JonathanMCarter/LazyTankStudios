  Dialogue:
  - You survived? What a stroke of luck.
  - Those creatures will no longer be a threat to those who travel on the roads.
  - "The threat isn\u2019t over yet. I\u2019m sending you to Karyna\u2019s stronghold,
    Black Glacier Post. Melt that bandits lair to the ground and leave no trace of
    her existence! You shall be a true hero of Serenna if you accomplish this task."
  - Prepare your people, their hibernation and suffering are coming to an end.
