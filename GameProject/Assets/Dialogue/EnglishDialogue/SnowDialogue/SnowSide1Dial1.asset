  - Please! Please! Help me stranger.
  - What has happened?
  - My son was picking apples for my special apple pie recipe, and he has not come
    home.
  - Where was he last seen?
  - "On the remote island of Skift located across the frozen lake. Near that godforsaken
    dungeon. I pray he\u2019s alright."
  - Not to worry, I shall find your son and bring him home.
