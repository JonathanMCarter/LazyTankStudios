  Dialogue:
  - "Isn\u2019t love a beautiful thing?"
  - Love is subjective... For me its rotting away in a cave somewhere!
  - How blind you are. My beloved Juliet must know how I feel about her. Please can
    you deliver this message to her. She is the other side of the square, I can't
    do it I'm on gaurd duty.
  - "I\u2019ll do this for your laziness, not love."
