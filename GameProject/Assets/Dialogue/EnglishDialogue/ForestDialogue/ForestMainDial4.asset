  Dialogue:
  - "What a feast I have been expecting. The forest has grown dull with no flavour
    of my next victim. Once you\u2019re on the fire I shall set the trees ablaze for
    all to see!"
  - You will not harm another soul on these sacred trees.
  - You wish to die for mother nature? How pathetic!
  - Says the bulldog bandit who kills for sport!
  - "That reminds me, I\u2019m due another match to the death! Prepare to lose weakling!"
