  Dialogue:
  - Psst! Hey you! Over here!
  - Why do you lurk within the shadows?
  - Would you keep your voice down! Anyone could be listening in!
  - "You\u2019re not hiding very well are you?"
  - I need your help... I am in need of some vials of blood from monsters that have
    been slain. Bring me some and I shall reward you.
  - What do you intend on doing with these vials?
  - That is not your concern! I can pay you when you bring 5 vials... You can find
    them scattered all around the snow region.
  - "I\u2019ll see what I can do."
