  Dialogue:
  - Psst! Psst! Over here!
  - "Why so secretive and kept to the shadows?\u201D"
  - Would you keep your voice down! Anyone could be listening in.
  - "You\u2019re not hiding it very well!"
  - Are you going to help or not? I am in the need of some vials of blood from monsters
    that have been slain. I can pay if you simply bring the vials to me.
  - What do you intend on doing with these vials?
  - That is not your concern! I can pay you when you bring 5 vials.
  - "I\u2019ll see what I can do."
