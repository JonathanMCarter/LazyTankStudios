  Dialogue:
  - I knew it! My faith in you paid off!
  - "You didn\u2019t pay me at all, you should have listened before instead of questioning
    my abilities."
  - That is true but heed my words. I shall reward you handsomely if you take down
    that puppet Skorge the 3rd and allow the sun to shine through the enchanted forest
    once more.
  - Rest assured I shall bring justice to all those that he has wronged.
