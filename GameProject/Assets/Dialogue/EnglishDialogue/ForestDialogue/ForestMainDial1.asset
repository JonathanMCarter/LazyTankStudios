  Dialogue:
  - Citizen! What are you doing here in the Cimmerian Forest?
  - I heard from the other regions that there is some trouble occurring in the enchanted
    part of Orelia.
  - Trouble?  There is more than trouble. Try living in this vine trap without having
    to look over your shoulder. You should head to the city of Nubrak and have a word
    with Lord Shreldo he is stood in front of the big fountain.
  - Thank you guard. To Nubrak I shall go.
  - Good luck! Mind the monsters on the road. They are very hungry!
