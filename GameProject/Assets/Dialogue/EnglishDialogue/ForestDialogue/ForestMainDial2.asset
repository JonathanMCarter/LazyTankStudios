  Dialogue:
  - What do we have here? A stranger in my court room? Or maybe an assassin to finish
    me off?!
  - "I wouldn\x19t go that far your lordship, I have come to remove the dark threats
    that lay within the land."
  - Are you speaking in riddles or have you had too much ale on the way here?
  - Joke all you want, I can take my skills elsewhere.
  - "Calm down. I was merely making light of the situation. It\x19s not been easy
    under the rule of the bulldog bandit, Skorge the 3rd.\x1D Every fighter I\x19ve
    hired has perished. You will need to prove your skills to me first."
  - What is your request?
  - I want you to head to the Venom Crypts and slay every beast that lurks within.
  - It will be done and when I return you shall honour our agreement!
