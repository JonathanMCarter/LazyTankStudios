  Dialogue:
  - The guard informed me that you bring news from Sharpton?
  - Yes my lord, I have come to warn you before Arespan shares the same fate!
  - I see. That senseless maniac must be stopped at once for the sake of Efeskdell.
  - I am more than willing to offer my services.
  - Willing is all well and good, but I need a hero to take on such a task. I'm not
    sure you are up to the task...  However given the circumstances I am offering
    you a chance to prove yourself. I want you to clear a dungeon south west of the
    city. If you succeed, then we shall talk further about how you can help!
  - Consider it done.
