  Dialogue:
  - "That\u2019s some fine work you did back there."
  - "What\u2019s it to you stranger?"
  - Be still friend, I meant no disrespect. Antwa sent me. Here is your reward for
    your services to the people of Efeskdell. It seems there are more threats on the
    road ahead...
  - Apologies, Jorah was just the beginning. There are more bandit chiefs out there.
    They will share the same fate as Jorrah.
  - Where will you go next?
  - Wherever the corruption leads me. I will seek out these bandit scum and end them!
  - Good luck, Hero.
