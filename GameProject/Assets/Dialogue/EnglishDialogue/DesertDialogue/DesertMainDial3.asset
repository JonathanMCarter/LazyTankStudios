  Dialogue:
  - "Well I never! No one has travelled as far as you have.\u201D Yet here you stand
    before me."
  - I hear you are suffering my lord, and not just from the sandstorms and scorching
    heat.
  - That is an understatement. Cutthroat Pierre has cursed the land with a blood trail
    at every corner of Amiri.
  - Then let me put an end to his rule.
  - "It\u2019s not that simple. I need someone I can trust to take on such a task."
  - "Then let me prove I\u2019m the person for the task."
  - "Hmmm, if you return successfully from the dungeon not far from here, I shall
    claim you as saviour of Azmar. The dungeon is called Aurora\u2019s Rest. Clear
    the beasts out and come back alive."
  - I shall be back soon.
