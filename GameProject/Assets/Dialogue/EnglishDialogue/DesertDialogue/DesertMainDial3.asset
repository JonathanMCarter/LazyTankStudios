  Dialogue:
  - "Well I never! No one has travelled as far as you have.\u201D Yet here you stand
    before me."
  - I hear you are suffering my Lord, and not just from the sandstorms and scorching
    heat...
  - That is an understatement! Cutthroat Pierre has cursed the land with a blood trail
    at every corner of Amiri.
  - Then let me put an end to his rule.
  - "It\u2019s not quite that simple... I need someone I can trust to take on such
    a task."
  - "Then let me prove I\u2019m the right person for the task."
  - "Hmmm... if you return successfully from the nearby dungeon, I shall claim you
    as saviour of Azmar. The dungeon is called Aurora\u2019s Rest. Clear out the beasts
    that dwell there return to me alive."
  - Very well, I shall be back soon.
