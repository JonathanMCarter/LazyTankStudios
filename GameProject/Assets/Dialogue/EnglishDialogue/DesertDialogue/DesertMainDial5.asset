  Dialogue:
  - Are you as deadly as the legends say? Or am I just fool to think you would really
    come here to take me on alone?
  - "Legends or not, there won\u2019t be many words to say about you when your body
    is buried in the sands!"
  - You think too much, that will get you nowhere in my realm!
  - We shall see about that!
