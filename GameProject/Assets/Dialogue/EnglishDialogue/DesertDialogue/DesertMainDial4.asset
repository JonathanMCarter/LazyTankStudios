  Dialogue:
  - Well done, not even Aurora herself stood a chance!
  - I have fulfilled my end of the bargain. Will you fulfil yours?
  - "Of course, I am a man of my word. I want you to head to the old desert kingdom
    of Adrudor and remove that sandy maniac\u2019s head from his body! Azmar will
    forever be in your debt!"
  - Amiri shall be great once again.
