  Dialogue:
  - NO NO!!! My power must prevail! The people shall still fear me!
  - You fought hard and lost Boska, every story must end... Even the most corrupt!
  - That may be so, I tried to give Orelia all I had. Without me they will be lost!
  - You gave them nothing but fear and poverty! They are free without you!
  - I hope I can make peace in the next life...
