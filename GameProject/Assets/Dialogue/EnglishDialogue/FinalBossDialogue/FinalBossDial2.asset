  Dialogue:
  - "At long last\u2026 A challenge worthy of my time! We aren't so different, you
    and I."
  - We are nothing alike, I kill for justice, you slaughter for fun!
  - Fun? I have made an empire with the actions and people I have placed in charge
    and you... You dared to challenge my power by removing my followers!
  - What a waste of time that was, they were no match for me, just like you who shall
    share the same fate!
  - "We\u2019ll see about that! I\u2019ll fashion a new Orelia with your death!"
