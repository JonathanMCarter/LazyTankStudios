  Dialogue:
  - I thank you Ulrira, on behalf of each region you have saved. Orelia is believing
    in hope once again.
  - It was my pleasure to save those under tyranny. The threat is far from over as
    they were only puppets.
  - Yes, Boska the Undefeated will not be happy how you killed his chiefs.
  - "He won\u2019t have much of a choice once I\u2019ve finished with him."
  - His lair is located by the Venom Crypt you cleared out. A secret entrance shall
    lead you right to him.
  - "I shall head there at once. Boska\u2019s time has come."
  - The fate of Orelia rests on your blade. Good luck.
