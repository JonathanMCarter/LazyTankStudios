  Dialogue:
  - Hero! Hero! Please! You must help me!
  - What seems to be the troubling you miss?
  - My brother, my brother has been kidnapped!
  - How did this happen?
  - That horrible cousin of the chaotic bandits took him! It all happened so fast.
  - Try to stay calm. Do you know where they went?
  - "There is a hidden dungeon not too far from Icemeet, it is in the eastern lands
    of Serenna. That\u2019s where they will be holding him."
  - Fear not, I shall head there and make sure this bandit cousin pays for this!
  - "Thank you, you\u2019re so brave! Before you go, you will need this key to unlock
    the door to the secret dungeon. Bring my brother back safe to me please!"
  - You have my word.
