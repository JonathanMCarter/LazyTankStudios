  Dialogue:
  - Thank you so much for saving me. my tunic was getting really itchy in that cell.
  - It was no trouble at all, Gerald is no more.
  - And good riddance to that. Where are my manners, I am the Tailor.
  - "Nice to meet you, I\u2019m Ulrira. How did you get kidnapped?"
  - Well funny story actually, I was on my way to fetch some wool and I was jumped
    by Gerald who tied me up and dragged me to this awful place.
  - Well be sure to check over your shoulder from now on.
  - "Oh I will. I can\u2019t repay you enough. Say, if you head to my shop located
    in the centre of the snow city of Icota, I can give you a wonderful gift!"
  - I am honoured, I shall see you there, until next time.
